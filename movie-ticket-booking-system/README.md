## How to run

__Before you start__ 

* Install Docker and Docker Compose
* Set up the connection to database in movie-service/src/config/db.js
* Set AMQP_URL variable in .env file 
(you can use a free 'Little Lemur' plan from [CloudAMQP](https://www.cloudamqp.com/))

```
#start services
docker-compose up -d

#fill db with sample data 
docker exec -it <MOVIE_SERVICE_CONTAINER_NAME> node src/init
```

After starting services web app is available on `http://localhost:80`

- **Temporary reservations** 

    *Reservations are implemented by using [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) 
    (each movie has own room -> each client subscribe only room/movie event which is actually browsed) 
    and stored in-memory on api-gateway.*
    *To improve api scalability on production, reservations should be stored in distributed DB like [Redis](https://redis.io/)*
